<img style="background-color:#662D91" src="_img/hack-a-doc-header.png"/>

We want great documentation.  It helps our customers discover, learn and become engaged to with our product.   We think that means the ability for everyone to contribute their expertise directly to customers.

## Goals

Our goals for the event: 

 * Get more people involved!  Increase the number of contributors coming directly from the PM and engineering teams.

 * Refresh and validate content on visualstudio.com and ALM documentation in MSDN for technical accuracy.

 * Improve overall ALM documentation.

 * Train everyone how to use git + markdown + VSO tools (via open authoring) to make changes to our ALM documentation on visualstudio.com and MSDN.

 * Generate some excitement to continue to contribute to documentation.

## Prepare

To make the most of this opportunity, take a few moments to prepare.

### Plan your work

Pick up or create a user story to help avoid collisions and duplicate work:

 * [Check out our list of stories](http://aka.ms/hackadoc-work)

  - See one you like that is not yet assigned? Assign it to yourself!

 * [Create a new doc story](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/VSOnline/Agile/_workItems/create/User%20Story?%5BSystem.Tags%5D=Doc%3B+Hack&%5BSystem.AreaPath%5D=VSOnline%5CVS+Cloud+Services%5C)

  - Add your feature team's area path so we can partner you with the writer who can help you slot the story into our content set.
