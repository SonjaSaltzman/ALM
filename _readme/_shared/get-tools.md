### Get Git

* Visual Studio with Git: 

  - 2013 is a stable choice, and it works with MarkdownMode (see below).

  - 2015 RC has enhancements in areas such as branch management. And it is goodness to dogfood. It does not work with MarkdownMode. 

  - 2012 is not recommended.

* Your favorite visual or command-prompt Git client.

### Get a Markdown editor

Some of us like these tools:

 * [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) Lots of people are starting to like this lightweight app, which provides both Markdown previewing and Git.

 * [MarkdownMode](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/STBCSI/e/CE/Azure%20Documents/MarkdownMode.vsix) Visual Studio 2013 plug-in

 * [MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/)

 * VI, or some some other austere developer-class text editor of your choice
