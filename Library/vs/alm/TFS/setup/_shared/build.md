If you're planning to use the build service and want an agent configured on your application tier, 
make sure the box is checked to enable it to auto-start.

![Configure the build service to start automatically checkbox](/Library/vs/alm/tfs/setup/_shared/_img/start-build-service.png)

If you change your mind, you can always enable the build agent on your application tier later.
You can also [configure additional build agents](/Library/vs/alm/build/agents/windows.md) after you have TFS up and running.
