A Team Foundation Server Standard license comes with a license to SQL Server Standard for use with TFS.
The [TFS licensing whitepaper](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13350) explains the details.
If you use the license that's included with TFS,
you can only use if for the TFS databases.

When you set up SQL Server up for TFS, install the database engine and the full text search services.
