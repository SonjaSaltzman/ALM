# Add reports to a team project
By adding a report server to your TFS (on-premises) deployment, you can access a wealth of data about your team's projects, such as build quality, bug trends, burndown, and test progress. SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports provide insight to help teams manage work and improve processes.
