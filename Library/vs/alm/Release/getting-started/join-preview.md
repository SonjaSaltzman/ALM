# Private preview program

**All the great features of this new version of Release Management 
are available to you now** as part of our private preview program. 
Private preview is the phase of a service development and release 
where we invite a selected set of customers to use the service 
and provide feedback. 

You can join the private preview program if you want to be part of
the evolution of the new version of Release Management. 
However, please note the following criteria for selection:

 * You must use the service on a regular basis. For example, 
   you should be deploying one or more of your real applications 
   through the release management service on a daily basis, at 
   least to your dev and test environments. This is necessary 
   for us to obtain timely feedback, as well as to test all of 
   the features.

 * We will do our best to respond quickly to your questions, and 
   to fix issues you come across. However, as this is still an 
   evolving service, you may need to be a little patient with 
   regard to new feature requests.
