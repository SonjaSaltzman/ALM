# Customize a process for import into Visual Studio Online

Visual Studio Online supports adding and updating processes through a web based [importing process](import-process.md) admin experience. 
Once you add a process, you can create one or more team project from it. 
You can update the process at any time by importing the process again and confirming that you want to update it.
These changes will be reflected in all team projects using that process.  

A process is a zip file containing a set of interdependent files used to define the building blocks of the work item tracking system as well as other sub-systems in Visual Studio Online.

While your custom process may contain the entire set of template files-plug-ins and object definition files-only a subset are validated upon import and then used to inform the process and update of existing team projects.  Specifically, the system performs the following actions on each of the plug-ins and objects defined within the process you choose for import.

![Supported process plug-ins and objects for process import](_img/ALM_IP_SupportedPlugins.png)

You'll find a summary of differences between what's supported in Visual Studio Online versus an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS) [here](differences.md).  
 
## How to customize a process
It's easiest to customize a process by starting with a well-defined process rather than building one from scratch.   
While you can update an existing process you've used with an on-premises TFS, you'll need 
to make sure it conforms to the [constraints placed on templates for import](#rule-summary).

1.  To export an existing process, open your web portal and switch to administration mode by choosing the gear icon.      
    ![Open administration context](_img/ALM_IP_OpenAdminContext.png)
 
2.  From the Process tab, open the context menu for the process that you want to export.      
    ![Export Process, choose process file to import](_img/ALM_IP_Export.png) 

    Save the zip file and extract all files.

3.	Rename the process in the ProcessTemplate.xml file located in the root folder.

    Name the process to distinguish it from existing ones.
    
    ```<name>MyCompany Agile Process  </name>```

    Change the version type, and major and minor numbers. Provide a distinct GUID for the type. For example: 

   ```<version type="F50EFC58-C2FC-4C66-9814-E395D90778A3" major="1" minor="1"/>```

4.	Apply [supported customizations](#supported-customizations).  
         
5.  Create a zip file of all files and folders in the root directory.

6.  [Import the zip file of your custom process](import-process.md).

### Process
Your ProcessTemplate.xml file must conform to the syntax and rules described in [ProcessTemplate XML element reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa395261%28v=vs.140%29.aspx). In additon, it must meet the following conditions:  
* Limit the number of WITs defined to 64
* Contain only one Categories.xml definition file  
* Contain only one ProcessConfiguration.xml definition file  
* Friendly names must be unique across all fields and WIT definitions
 
In addition, your process must pass the following validation checks:  
* Process names must be unique and 155 Unicode characters or less.
  * Templates with the same name and version GUID will overwrite existing processes. 
  * Templates with the same name but a different version GUID will generate an error.  
  * Process names cannot contain the following special characters:  
     ```. , ; ' ` : / \ * | ? " & % $ ! + = ( ) [ ] { } < >  ```  
    See [Naming restrictions](../customize/naming-restrictions.md) for additional constraints.
* Process folders canâ€™t contain any .exe files. While you may be able to import the process that contains a .exe file, project creation will fail.
* Process total size should be 2 GB or less, or project creation will fail.
 
<a id="process-configuration"></a>
### Process configuration
The ProcessConfiguration.xml definition file must conform to the syntax and rules described in [ProcessConfiguration XML element reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh500408%28v=vs.140%29.aspx). In additon, it must meet the following conditions:

<a id="work-item-fields"></a>
### Work item fields
The ```FIELDS``` section and its child elements must conform to the syntax and rules described in [FIELD XML element reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa337627%28v=vs.140%29.aspx). In addition, it must meet the following conditions:      
*   ```FIELD``` element and child elements can't contain a ```GLOBALLIST``` element  
*   The friendly name and required refname assigned to a WIT must be unique within the set of WIT definition files  
*   The required refname attribute value can't contain disallowed characters nor use a disallowed namespace: System.*Name* and Microsoft.*Name*    
    Reference names must contain only letters, no spaces, and at least one period (.). 

<a id="limits"></a>
#### Limit restrictions  
*   Limit definition to 512 fields 
*   Limit definition of person-name fields, ones with an attribute of ```syncnamechange=true```, to 16 
*   Limit definition of ```LISTITEM```elements within an ```ALLOWEDVALUES``` or ```SUGGESTEDVALUES``` element for a field to 128 
*   Limit definition of allowed rules to 1024 for a field. 

<a id="required-fields"></a>
#### Required fields
*   For all WITs that belong to a category used to define a process configuration backlog, specify the field used for ```type=Team``` in the ProcessConfiguration.xml file 
*   For all WITs that belong to a category used to define a process configuration backlog, specify the field used for ```type=Order``` in the ProcessConfiguration.xml file    
*   For all WITs that belong to a category used to define a regular backlog or portfolio backlog, specify the field used for ```type=Effort``` in the ProcessConfiguration.xml file

*   For all WITs that belong to the category used to define the ```TaskBacklog```, specify the ```ALLOWEDVALUES``` rule for the field used for ```type=Activity``` in the ProcessConfiguration.xml file 

<a id="rule-restrictions"></a>
#### Rule restrictions
In addition to the standard [field rule restrictions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms404857%28v=vs.140%29.aspx), the following restrictions are enforced:
*   Field rule elements can't specify the *for* and *not* attributes   
*   ```FIELD``` elements can't contain the following child rule elements: ```CANNOTLOSEVALUE```, ```GLOBALLIST```, ```NOTSAMEAS```, ```MATCH```, ```PROHIBITEDVALUES``` 
*   ```FIELD``` definitions for System.*Name* fields can't contain field rules, except for the following fields:  
    *   System.Title can contain the rules: ```REQUIRED``` and ```DEFAULT```    
    *   System.Description can contain the rules: ```REQUIRED``` and ```DEFAULT```    
    *   System.AssignedTo can contain the rules: ```REQUIRED```, ```DEFAULT```, ```ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE``` and ```VALIDUSER```      
    *   System.ChangedBy can contain the rules: ```REQUIRED```, ```DEFAULT```, ```ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE``` and ```VALIDUSER```.    

<a id="consistent-names-attributes"></a>
#### Consistent names and attributes   
*   Within the process: ```name```, ```type```, and other attributes defined within a ```FIELD``` element must be the same across all WIT definitions
*   Within a project collection: ```name```, ```type```, and other attributes defined within a ```FIELD``` element must be the same across all WIT definitions      

<a id="identity-fields"></a>
#### Identity fields 
Identity fields correspond to fields used to contain account, user, or group names. 
The following core system fields are hard-coded as identity fields:    
*   Assigned To (System.AssignedTo)  
*   Authorized As (System.AuthorizedAs)
*   Changed By (System.ChangedBy)   
*   Created By (System.CreatedBy)  
 
The following fields are only considered identity fields if an identity rule is applied to their ```FIELD``` definition. 
*   Activated By (Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ActivatedBy)  
*   Closed By (Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedBy)  
*   Resolved By (Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ResolvedBy)  

**Rules that cause a string field to be considered an identity field**
A string field is recognized as an identity field when you specify one of the following rule elements within its ```FIELD``` definition:
*   ```ALLOWEDVALUES```  
*   ```PROHIBITEDVALUES```
*   ```VALIDUSER```   

**Rule restrictions on identity fields**
For the current release of import process, the following restrictions are in effect: 
1.  Don't specify any of the following rules within the ```FIELD``` definition of an identity field: 
    *   ```ALLOWEDVALUES```  
    *   ```PROHIBITEDVALUES```
    *   ```SUGGESTEDVALUES```   
2.  Don't specify any rules that contain non-identity values within the ```FIELD``` definition of an identity field.  

**Correct example**   
To limit the account names that are valid within an identity field, specify the  ```VALIDUSER```  with a group name attribute.   
```
    <FIELD name="Project Manager" refname="Fabrikam.ProgramManager" type="String" reportable="dimension" syncnamechanges="true">
        <ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE />
        <VALIDUSER group="[PROJECT]\Program Manager Group" />
        <HELPTEXT>The program manager responsible for signing off on the user story.</HELPTEXT>
    </FIELD>
```
Prior to importing the process, make sure that you've created the group in the team project(s) that the process will update. 


**Incorrect example**  
The following example isn't valid as it specifies the ```ALLOWEDVALUES``` element and the ```DEFAULT``` element which specifies ```value="Not Assigned"```, a non-identity string.    
```
    <FIELD name="Project Manager" refname="Fabrikam.ProgramManager" type="String" reportable="dimension" syncnamechanges="true">
        <ALLOWEXISTINGVALUE />
        <ALLOWEDVALUES>
          <LISTITEM value="[PROJECT]\Program Manager Group" />
          <LISTITEM value="Not Assigned" />
        </ALLOWEDVALUES>
        <DEFAULT from="value" value="Not Assigned" />
        <VALIDUSER />
        <HELPTEXT>The program manager responsible for signing off on the user story.</HELPTEXT>
    </FIELD>
```
<a id="work-item-workflow"></a>
### Workflow
The  ```WORKFLOW``` element and its child elements must conform to the syntax and rules described in [WORKFLOW XML element reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg534715%28v=vs.140%29.aspx). In addition, it must meet the following conditions:   
*   Limit definition of workflow states to 16 for each WIT 
*   Must define all workflow states that are mapped to a metastate in the ProcessConfiguration definition file        
*   Must define a transition between all workflow states that are mapped to the ```Proposed``` metastate and workflow states mapped to the ```InProgress``` metastate    
*   Must define a transition between all workflow states that are mapped to the ```InProgress``` metastate and workflow states mapped to the ```Complete``` metastate.   

<a id="work-item-form-layout"></a>
### Form layout 
The ```FORM``` element and its child elements must conform to the syntax and rules described in [FORM XML element reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms194963%28v=vs.140%29.aspx).   
The ```Control``` element can't specify a custom control. Custom controls aren't supported.
